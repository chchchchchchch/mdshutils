<p>This interview about the practice of OSP was carried out by e-mail 
<strong>between March and May 2008</strong>. Matthew Fuller writes about 
software culture and has a contagious interest in technologies that exceed 
easy fit solutions. At the time, he was David Gee reader in Digital Media 
at the Centre for Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths College, University of 
London, and had just edited <em>Software Studies, A Lexicon</em>, 

 and written <em>Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and 
Technoculture</em> 

 and <em>Behind the Blip: Essays on the Culture of Software</em>.

<p class="mf">OSP is a graphic design agency working solely with Open 
Source software. This surely places you currently as a world first, but 
what exactly does it mean in practice? Let&#8217;s start with what 
software you use?</p>

<p class="fs">There are other groups publishing with Free Software, but 
design collectives are surprisingly rare. So much publishing is going on 
around Open Source and Open Content &#8230; someone must have had the same 
idea? In discussions about digital tools you begin to find designers 
expressing concern over the fact that their work might all look the same 
because they use exactly the same Adobe suite and as a way to 
differentiate yourself, Free Software could soon become more popular. I 
think the success of Processing is related to that, though I doubt such a 
composed project will ever make anyone seriously consider Scribus for page 
layout, even if Processing is Open Source.</p>

<p>OSP usually works between GIMP, <sup><a href="#cc199abe">1</a></sup> 
Scribus <sup><a href="#9a83c209">2</a></sup> and Inkscape <sup><a 
href="#14bce5c1">3</a></sup> on Linux distributions and OSX. We are fans 
of FontForge, <sup><a href="#05dff23a">4</a></sup> and enjoy using all 
kinds of commandline tools, <tt>psnup</tt>, <tt>ps2pdf</tt> and 
<tt>uniq</tt> to name a few.</p>

<p class="mf">How does the use of this software change the way you work, 
do you see some possibilities for new ways of doing graphic design opening 
up?</p>

<p class="fs">For many reasons, software has become much more present in 
our work; at any moment in the workflow it makes itself heard. As a result 
we feel a bit less sure of ourselves, and we have certainly become slower. 
We decided to make the whole process into some kind of design/life 
experiment and that is one way to keep figuring out how to convert a file, 
or yet another discussion with a printer about which 
&#8216;standard&#8217; to use, interesting for ourselves. Performing our 
practice is as much part of the project as the actual books, posters, 
flyers etc. we produce.</p>

<p>One way a shift of tools can open up new ways of doing graphic design, 
is because it makes you immediately aware of the &#8216;resistance&#8217; 
of digital material. At the point we can&#8217;t make things work, we 
start to consider formats, standards and other limitations as ingredients 
for creative work. We are quite excited for example about exploring 
dynamic design for print in SVG, a by-product of our battle with 
converting files from Scalable Vector Format into Portable Document 
Format.</p>

<p>Free Software allows you to engage on many levels with the technologies 
and processes around graphic design. When you work through it&#8217;s 
various interfaces, stringing tools together, circumventing bugs and/or 
gaps in your own knowledge, you understand there is more to be done than 
contributing code in C++. It is an invitation to question assumptions of 
utility, standards and usability. This is exactly the stuff design is made 
of.</p>

<p class="mf">Following this, what kind of team have you built up, and 
what new competencies have you had to develop?</p>

<p class="fs">The core of OSP is five people <sup><a 
href="#16467489">5</a></sup>, and between us we mix amongst others 
typography, layout, cartography, webdesign, software development, drawing, 
programming, open content licensing and teaching. Around it is a larger 
group of designers, a mathematician, a computer scientists and several 
Free Software coders that we regularly exchange ideas with.</p>

<p>It feels we often do more unlearning than learning; a necessary and 
interesting skill to develop is dealing with incompetence &#8211; what can 
it be else than a loss of control? In the mean time we expand our 
vocabulary so we can fuel conversations (imaginary and real life) with 
people behind GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus etc.; we learn how to navigate our 
computers using commandline interfaces as well as KDE, GNOME and others; 
we find out about file formats and how they sometimes can and often cannot 
speak to each other; how to write manuals and interact with mailing lists. 
The real challenge is to invent situations that subvert strict divisions 
of labour while leaving space for the kind of knowledge that comes with 
practice and experience.</p>

<p class="mf">Open fonts seem to be the beginnings of a big success, how 
does it fit into the working practices of typographers or the material 
with which they work?</p>

<p class="fs">Type design is an extraordinary area where Free Software and 
design naturally meet. I guess this area of work is what kernel coding is 
for a Linux developer: only a few people actually make fonts but many 
people use them all the time. Software companies have been inconsistent in 
developing proprietary tools for editing fonts, which has made the work of 
typographers painfully difficult at times. This is why George Williams 
decided to develop FontForge, and release it under a BSD license: even if 
he stops being interested, others can take over. FontForge has gathered a 
small group of fans who through this tool, stay into contact with a more 
generous approach to software, characters and typefaces.</p>

<p>The actual material of a typeface has since long migrated from 
poisonous lead into sets of ultra light vector drawings, held together in 
complicated kerning systems. When you take this software-like aspect as a 
startingpoint, many ways to collaborate (between programmers and 
typographers; between people speaking different languages) open up, as 
long as you let go of the uptight licensing policies that apply to most 
commercial fonts. I guess the image of the solitary master passing on the 
secret trade to his devoted pupils does not sit very well with the 
invitation to anyone to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve. 
How open fonts could turn the patriarchal guild system inside out that has 
been carefully preserved in the closed world of type design, is obviously 
of interest as well.</p>

<p>Very concretely, computer-users really need larger character sets that 
allow for communication between let&#8217;s say Greek, Russian, Slovak and 
French. These kinds of vast projects are so much easier to develop and 
maintain in a Free Software way; the D&#233;J&#224;Vu font project shows 
that it is possible to work with many people spread over different 
countries modifying the same set of files with the help of versioning 
systems like CVS.</p>

<p>But what it all comes down to probably&#8230; Donald Knuth is the only 
person I have seen both Free Software developers and designers wear on 
their T-shirts.</p>

<p class="mf">The cultures around each of the pieces of software are quite 
distinct. People often lump all F/LOSS development into one kind of 
category, whereas even in the larger GNU/Linux distros there is quite a 
degree of variation, but with the smaller more specialised projects this 
is perhaps even more the case. How would you characterise the scenes 
around each of these applications?</p>

<p class="fs">The kinds of applications we use form a category in 
themselves. They are indeed small projects so &#8216;scene&#8217; fits 
them better than &#8216;culture&#8217;. Graphics tools differ from 
archetypal Unix/Linux code and language based projects in that Graphical 
User Interfaces obviously matter and because they are used in a 
specialised context outside its own developers circle. This is interesting 
because it makes F/LOSS developer communities connect with other 
disciplines (or scenes?) such as design, printing and photography.</p>

<p>A great pleasure in working with F/LOSS is to experience how software 
can be done in many ways; each of the applications we work with is alive 
and particular. I&#8217;ll just portray Scribus and Inkscape here because 
from the differences between these two I think you can imagine what else 
is out there.</p>

<p>The Scribus team is rooted in the printing and pre-press world and 
naturally their first concern is to create an application that produces 
reliable output. Any problem you might run in to at a print shop will be 
responded to immediately, even late night if necessary. Members of the 
Scribus team are a few years older than average developers and this can be 
perceived through the correct and friendly atmosphere on their mailing 
list and IRC channel, and their long term loyalty to this complex project. 
Following its more industrial perspective, the imagined design workflow 
built in to the tool is linear. To us it feels almost pre-digital: tasks 
and responsibilities between editors, typesetters and designers are 
clearly defined and lined up. In this view on design, creative decisions 
are made outside the application, and the canvas is only necessary for 
emergency corrections. Unfortunately for us, who live of testing and 
trying, Scribus&#8217; GUI is a relatively underdeveloped area of a 
project that otherwise has matured quickly.</p>

<p>Inkscape is a fork of a fork of a small tool initially designed to edit 
vector files in SVG format. It stayed close to its initial starting point 
and is in a way a much more straightforward project than Scribus. Main 
developer Bryce Harrington describes Inkscape as <em>a relatively 
unstructured coming and going of high energy collective work</em> much 
work is done through a larger group of people submitting small patches and 
it&#8217;s developers community is not very tightly knit. Centered around 
a legible XML format primarily designed for the web, Inkscape users 
quickly understand the potential of scripting images and you can find a 
vibrant plug in culture even if the Inkscape code is less clean to work 
with than you might expect. Related to this interest in networked visuals, 
is the involvement of Inkscape developers in the Open Clip Art project and 
ccHost, a repository system wich allows you to upload images, sounds and 
other files directly from your application. It is also no surprise that 
Inkscape implemented a proper print dialogue only very late, and still has 
no way to handle CMYK output.</p>

<p class="mf">There&#8217;s a lot of talk about collaboration in F/LOSS 
development, something very impressive, but often when one talks to 
developers of such software there is a lot to discuss about the rather 
less open ways in which power struggles over the meaning or leadership of 
software projects are carried out by, for instance, hiding code in 
development, or by only allowing very narrowly technical approaches to 
development to be discussed. This is only one tendency, but one which 
tends to remain publicly under-discussed. How much of this kind of 
friction have you encountered by acting as a visible part of a new user 
community for F/LOSS?</p>

<p class="fs">I can&#8217;t say we feel completely at home in the F/LOSS 
world, but we have not encountered any extraordinary forms of friction 
yet. We have been allowed the space to try our own strategies at 
overcoming the user-developer divide: people granted interviews, accepted 
us when we invited ourselves to speak at conferences and listened to our 
stories. But it still feels a bit awkward, and I sometimes wonder whether 
we ever will be able to do enough. Does constructive critique count as a 
contribution, even when it is not delivered in the form of a bug report? 
Can we please get rid of the term &#8216;end-user&#8217;?</p>

<p>Most discussions around software are kept strictly technical, even when 
there are many non-technical issues at stake. We are F/LOSS enthusiasts 
because it potentially pulls the applications we use into some form of 
public space where they can be examined, re-done and taken apart if 
necessary; we are curious about how they are made because of what they 
(can) make you do. When we asked Andreas Vox, a main Scribus developer 
whether he saw a relation between the tool he contributed code to, and the 
things that were produced by it, he answered: <em>Preferences for work 
tools and political preference are really orthogonal</em>. This is 
understandable from a project-management point of view, but it makes you 
wonder where else such a debate should take place.</p>

<p class="mf">Visually, or in terms of the aesthetic qualities of the 
designs you have developed would you say you have managed to achieve 
anything unavailable through the output of the Adobe empire?</p>

<p class="fs">The members of OSP would never have come up with the idea to 
combine their aesthetics and skills using Adobe, so that makes it 
difficult to do a &#8216;before&#8217; and &#8216;after&#8217; comparison. 
Or maybe we should call this an achievement of Free Software too?</p>

<p>Using F/LOSS has made us reconsider the way we work and sometimes this 
is visible in the design we produce, more often in the commissions we take 
on or the projects we invest in. Generative work has become part of our 
creative suite and this certainly looks different than a per-page 
treatment; also deliberate traces of the production process (including 
printing and pre-press) add another layer to what we make.</p>

<p>Of all smaller and larger discoveries, the Spiro toolkit that Free 
Software activist, Ghostscript maintainer, typophile and Quaker Raph 
Levien develops, must be the most wonderful. We had taken B&#233;zier 
curves for granted, and never imagined how the way it is mathematically 
defined would matter that much. Instead of working with fixed anchor 
points and starting from straight lines that you first need to bend, Spiro 
is spiral-based and vectors suddenly have a sensational flow and weight. 
From Pierre B&#233;zier writing his specification as an engineer for the 
Renault car factory to Levien&#8217;s Spiro, digital drawing has changed 
radically.</p>

<p class="mf">You have a major signage project coming up, how does this 
commission map across to the ethics and technologies of F/LOSS?</p>

<p class="fs">We are right in the middle of it. At this moment &#8216;The 
Pavilion of Provisionary Happiness&#8217; celebrating the 50th anniversary 
of the Belgian World Exhibition, is being constructed out of 30.000 beer 
crates right under the Brussels&#8217; Atomium. That&#8217;s a major 
project done the Belgian way.</p>

<p>We have developed a signage system, or actually a typeface, which is 
defined through the strange material and construction work going on on 
site. We use holes in the facade that are in fact handles of beer crates 
as connector points to create a modular font that is somewhere between 
Pixacao graffiti and Cuneiform script. It is actually a play on our long 
fascination with engineered typefaces such as DIN 1451; mixing universal 
application with specific materials, styles and uses &#8211; this all 
links back to our interest in Free Software.</p>

<p>Besides producing the signage, OSP will co-edit and distribute a modest 
publication documenting the whole process; it makes legible how this 
temporary yellow cathedral came about. And the font will of course be 
released in the public domain.</p>

<p>It is not an easy project but I don&#8217;t know how much of it has to 
do with our software politics; our commissioners do not really care and 
also we have kept the production process quite simple on purpose. But by 
opening our sources, we can use the platform we are given in a more 
productive way; it makes us less dependent because the work will have 
another life long after the deadline has passed.</p>

<p class="mf">On this project, and in relation to the seeming omnipresence 
in F/LOSS of the idea that this technology is &#8216;universal&#8217;, how 
do you see that in relation to fonts, and their longer history of 
standards?</p>

<p class="fs">That is indeed a long story, but I&#8217;ll give it a try. 
First of all, I think the idea of universal technology appears to be quite 
omnipresent everywhere; the mix-up between ubiquitousness and 
&#8216;universality&#8217; is quickly made. In Free Software this idea 
gains force only when it gets (con)fused with freedom and openness and 
when conditions for access are kept out of the discussion.</p>

<p>We are interested in early typographic standardization projects because 
their minimalist modularity brings out the tension between generic systems 
and specific designs. Ludwig Goller, a Siemens engineer wo headed the 
Committee for German Industry Standards in the 1920s stated that <em>For 
the typefaces of the future neither tools nor fashion will be 
decisive</em>. His committee supervised the development of DIN 1451, a 
standard font that should connect economy of use with legibility, and 
enhance global communication in service of the German industry. I think it 
is no surprise that a similar phrasing can be found in W3C documents; the 
idea to unify the people of the world through a common language 
re-surfaces and has the same tendency to negate materiality and 
specificity in favour of seamless translation between media and 
markets.</p>

<p>Type historian Ellen Lupton brought up the possibility of designing 
typographic systems that are accessible but not finite nor operating 
within a fixed set of parameters. Although I don&#8217;t know what she 
means by using the term &#8216;open universal&#8217;, I think this is why 
we are attracted to Free Software: it has the potential to open up both 
the design of parameters as well as their application. Which leads to your 
next question.</p>

<p class="mf">You mentioned the use of generative design just now. How far 
do you go into this? Within the generative design field there seem to be a 
couple of tendencies, one that is very pragmatic, simply about exploring a 
space of possible designs through parametric definition in order to find, 
select and breed from and tweak a good result that would not be 
necessarily imaginable otherwise, the other being more about the inefible 
nature of the generative process itself, something vitalist. These 
tendencies of not of course exclusive, but how are they inflected or 
challenged in your use of generative techniques?</p>

<p class="fs">I feel a bit on thin ice here because we only start to 
explore the area and we are certainly not deep into algorithmic design. 
But on a more mundane level&#8230; in the move from print to design for 
the web, &#8216;grids&#8217; have been replaced by &#8216;templates&#8217; 
that interact with content and context through filters. Designers have 
always been busy with designing systems and formats, <sup><a 
href="#2672ceb8">6</a></sup> but stepped in to manipulate singular results 
if necessary.</p>

<p>I referred to &#8216;generative design&#8217; as the space opening up 
when you play with rules and their affordances. The liveliness and 
specificity of the work results from various parameters interfering with 
each other, including the ones we can get our hands on. By making our own 
manipulations explicit, we sometimes manage to make other parameters at 
play visible too. Because at the end of the day, we are rather bored by 
mysterious beauty.</p>

<p class="mf">One of the techniques OSP uses to get people involved with 
the process and the technologies is the &#8216;Print Party&#8217;, can you 
say what that is?</p>

<p class="fs">'Print Parties' are irregular public performances we 
organise when we feel the need to report on what we discovered and where 
we&#8217;ve been; as anti-heroes of our own adventures we open up our 
practice in a way that seems infectious. We make a point of presenting a 
new experiment, of producing something printed and also something edible 
on site each time; this mix of ingredients seems to work best. 'Print 
Parties' are how we keep contact with our fellow designers who are 
interested in our journey but have sometimes difficulty following us into 
the exotic territory of BoF, Version Control and GPL3.</p>

<p class="mf">You state in a few texts that OSP is interested in glitches 
as a productive force in software, how do you explain this to a printer 
trying to get a file to convert to the kind of thing they expect?</p>

<p class="fs">Not! Printing has become cheap through digitization and is 
streamlined to the extreme. Often there is literally no space built in to 
even have a second look at a differently formatted file, so to state that 
glitches are productive is easier said than done. Still, those hickups 
make processes tangible, especially at moments you don&#8217;t want them 
to interfere.</p>

<p>For a book we are designing at the moment, we might partially work by 
hand on positive film (a step now also skipped in file-to-plate systems). 
It makes us literally sit with pre-press professionals for a day and 
hopefully we can learn better where to intervene and how to involve them 
into the process. To take the productive force of glitches beyond 
predictable aesthetics, means most of all a shift of rhythm &#8211; to 
effect other levels than the production process itself. We gradually learn 
how our ideas about slow cooking design can survive the instant need to 
meet deadlines. The terminology is a bit painful but to replace 
&#8216;deadline&#8217; by &#8216;milestone&#8217;, and 
&#8216;estimate&#8217; by &#8216;roadmap&#8217; is already a beginning.</p>

<p class="mf">One of the things that is notable about OSP is that the 
problems that you encounter are also described, appearing on your blog. 
This is something unusual for a company attempting to produce the 
impression of an efficient &#8216;solution&#8217;. Obviously the readers 
of the blog only get a formatted version of this, as a performed work? 
What&#8217;s the thinking here?</p>

<p class="fs">&#8216;Efficient solutions&#8217; is probably the last thing 
we try to impress with, though it is important for us to be grounded in 
practice and to produce for real under conventional conditions. The blog 
is a public record of our everyday life with F/LOSS; we make an effort to 
narrate through what we stumble upon because it helps us articulate how we 
use software, what it does to us and what we want from it; people that 
want to work with us, are somehow interested in these questions too. Our 
audience is also not just prospective clients, but includes developers and 
colleagues. An unformatted account, even if that was possible, would not 
be very interesting in that respect; we turn software into fairytales if 
that is what it takes to make our point.</p>

<p class="mf">In terms of the development of F/LOSS approaches in areas 
outside software, one of the key points of differentiation has been 
between &#8216;recipes&#8217; and &#8216;food&#8217;, bits and atoms, 
genotype and phenotype. That is that software moves the kinds of rivalry 
associated with the ownership and rights to use and enjoy a physical 
object into another domain, that of speed and quality of information, 
which network distribution tends to mitigate against. This is also the 
same for other kinds of data, such as music, texts and so on. (This 
migration of rivalry is often glossed over in the description of 
&#8216;goods&#8217; being &#8216;non-rivalrous&#8217;.) Graphic Design 
however is an interesting middle ground in a certain way in that it both 
generates files of many different kinds, and, often but not always, 
provides the &#8216;recipes&#8217; for physical objects, the actual 
&#8216;voedingstof&#8217;, such as signage systems, posters, books, labels 
and so on. Following this, do you circulate your files in any particular 
way, or by other means attempt to blur the boundary between the recipe and 
the food?</p>

<p class="fs">We have just finished the design of a font 
(NotCourier-sans), a derivative of Nimbus Mono, which is in turn a 
GPL&#8217;ed copy of the well known Courier typeface that IBM introduced 
in 1955. Writing a proper licence for it, opened up many questions about 
the nature of &#8216;source code&#8217; in design, and not only from a 
legalist perspective. While this is actually relatively simple to define 
for a font (the source is the object), it is much less clear what it means 
for a signage system or a printed book.</p>

<p>One way we deal with this, is by publishing final results side by side 
with ingredients and recipes. The raw files themselves seem pretty useless 
once the festival is over and the book printed, so we write manuals, 
stories, histories. We also experiment with using versioning systems, but 
the softwares available are only half interesting to us. Designed to 
support code development, changes in text files can be tracked up to the 
minutest detail but unless you are ready to track binary code, images and 
document layouts function as black boxes. I think this is something we 
need to work on because we need better tools to handle multiple file 
formats collaboratively, and some form of auto-documentation to support 
the more narrative work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, manuals and licences are surprisingly rich formats 
if you want to record how an object came into life; we often weave these 
kinds of texts back into the design itself. In the case of NotCourierSans 
we will package the font with a pdf booklet on the history of the typeface 
&#8211; mixing design geneology with suggestions for use.</p>

<p>I think the blurring of boundaries happens through practice. Just like 
recipes are linked in many ways to food, <sup><a 
href="#2d31e6df">7</a></sup> design practice connects objects to 
conditions. OSP is most of all interested in the back-and-forth between 
those two states of design; rendering their interdepence visible and 
testing out ways of working with it rather than against it. Hopefully both 
the food and the recipe will change in the process.</p>
