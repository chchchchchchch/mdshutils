<h1> Just Ask and That Will Be That</h1>

<p>This conversation took place in Montreal at the last day of the 
<strong>Libre Graphics Meeting 2011</strong>. In the panel <em>How to keep 
and make productive libre graphics projects?</em>, Asheesh had responded 
rather sharply to a remark from the audience that only a very small number 
of women were present at LGM: <em>Bringing the problem back to gender is 
avoiding the general problem that F/LOSS has with social inclusion.</em> 
Another good reason to talk to him were the intriguing 'Interactive 
training missions' that he had been developing as part of the 
OpenHatch.org project. I wanted to know more about the tutorials he 
develops; why he decided to work on 'story manuals' that explain how to 
report a bug or how to work with version control. Asheesh Laroia is 
someone who realizes that most of the work that makes projects successful 
is hidden underneath the surface. He volunteered his technical skills for 
the UN in Uganda, the EFF, and Students for Free Culture, and is a 
developer on the Debian team. Today, he lives in Somerville, MA. He speaks 
about his ideas to audiences at international F/LOSS conferences.</p>

<p class="ala">The interactive training missions are really linked to the 
background of the OpenHatch project itself. I started working on it 
because to my mind, one of the biggest reasons that people do not 
participate in Free Software projects, is that they either don't know how 
or don't feel included. There is a lot you have to know to be a meaningful 
contributor to Free Software and I think that one of the major obstacle 
for getting that knowledge, and I am being a bit sloppy with the use of 
the term maybe, is how to understand a conversation on a bug-tracker for 
example. This is not something you run into in college, learning computer 
science or any other discipline. In fact, it is an almost anti-academic 
type of knowledge. Bug tracker conversations are 'just people talking', a 
combination of a comment thread on a blog and actual planning documents. 
There's also tools like version control, where close to no one learns 
about in college. There is something like the culture of participating in 
mailing lists and chatting on IRC... what people will expect to hear and 
what people are expecting from you.</p>

<p>For people like me that have been doing all these things for years, it 
feels very natural and it is very easy to forget all the advantages I have 
in this regard. But a lot of the ways people get to the point where I am 
now involves having friends that help out, like <em>Hey, I asked what I 
thought was a reasonable question on this mailing list and I did not get 
any answer</em> or <em>what they said wasn't very helpful</em>. At this 
stage, if you are lucky, you have a friend that helps you stay in the 
community. If you don't, you fall away and think <em>I'm not going to deal 
with this, I don't understand</em>. So, the training missions are designed 
to give you the cultural experience and the tool familiarity in an 
automated way. You can stay in the community even when you don't have a 
friend, because the robot will explain you what is going on.</p>

<p class="fs">So how do you 'harvest' this cultural information? And how 
do you bring it into your tool?</p>

<p class="ala">There is some creative process in what I call 'writing the 
plot'; this is very linear. Each training mission is usually between three 
and fifteen minutes long so it is OK to have them be linear. In writing 
the plot, you just imagine what would it take a new contributor to 
understand not only what to do, but also what a 'normal community member' 
would know to do. The different training missions get this right to 
different extents.</p>

<p class="fs">How does this type of knowledge form, you think? Did you 
need to become a kind of anthropologist of Free Software? How do you know 
you teach the right thing?</p>

<p class="ala">I spend a lot of time both working with and thinking about 
new contributions to Free Software. Last September I organized a workshop 
to teach computer science students how to get involved in Open Source. And 
I have also been teaching interpersonally, in small groups, for ten or 
eleven years. So I use the workshops to test the missions and than I 
simply ask what works. But it is tough to evaluate the training missions 
through workshops because the workshops are intended to be more 
interpersonal. I definitely had positive feedback, but we need more, 
especially from people that have been two or three years involved in the 
Free Software community, because they understand what it feels like to be 
part of a community but they may still feel somewhat unsure about whether 
they have everything and still remember what was confusing to learn.</p>

<p class="fs">I wasn't actually asking about how successful the missions 
are in teaching the culture Free Software ... I wanted to know how the 
missions learn from this culture?</p>

<p class="ala">So far, the plots are really written by me, in 
collaboration with others. We had one more recent contribution on Git 
written by someone called Mark Freeman who is involved in the OpenHatch 
project. It did not have so much community discussion but it was also 
pretty good from the start. So I basically try to dump what is in my 
head?</p>

<p class="fs">I am asking you about this, thinking about a session we once 
organized at Samedies, a woman-and-Free-Software group from Brussels. We 
had invited someone to come talk to us about using IRC on the command-line 
and she was discussing etiquette. She said: <em>On IRC you should never 
ask permission before asking a question</em>. This was the kind of 
cultural knowledge she was teaching us and I was a bit puzzled ... you 
could also say that this lack of social interfacing on IRC is a problem. 
So why replicate that?</p>

<p class="ala">In Debian we have a big effort to check the quality of 
packages and maintaining that quality, even if the developer goes away. It 
is called the 'Debian QA project' and there's an IRC channel linked to 
that called #debian-qa. Some of the people on that channel like to say 
hello to each other and pay attention when other people are speaking, and 
others said <em>stop with all the noise</em>. So finally, the people that 
liked saying hello moved to another channel: #debian-sayhi.</p>

<p class="fs">Meaning the community has made explicit how it wants to be 
spoken to?</p>

<p class="ala">The point I am trying to make here, is that I am agreeing 
to part of what you are saying, that these norms are actually flexible. 
But what I am further saying, is that these norms are actually being 
bent.</p>

<p class="fs">I would like to talk about the new mission on bug reporting 
you said you were working on, and how that is going. I find bug reports 
interesting because if they're good, they mix observation and narration, 
which asks a lot from the imagination of both the writer and the reader of 
the report; they need to think themselves in each others place: What did I 
expect that would happen? What should have happened? What could have gone 
wrong? Would you say your interactive training missions are a continuation 
of this collective imaginary work?</p>

<p class="ala">A big part of that sort of imagination is understanding the 
kinds of things that could be reasonable. So this is where cultural 
knowledge comes in. If you program in C or even if you just read about C, 
you understand that there is something called 'pointers' and something 
called 'segfaults' and if your program ends in that way, that is not a 
good thing and you should report a bug. This requires an imagination on 
the side of the person filing the bug. The training missions give people 
practice in seeing these sorts of things and understand how they could 
work. To build a mental model, even if it is fuzzy, that has enough of the 
right components so they can enter in discussion and imagine what 
happened. I have mixed feelings about using 'gender' as an important 
characteristic when considering how to grow our communities. It is not a 
bad idea maybe, and I am working on projects that are related to this as 
well, but I think it permits a misunderstanding of the problem and puts 
things in an awkward space, especially when the issue is addressed in a 
room primarily filled by men and only a few woman. Is what the men say 
sort of judge-able by the few women in the room? Are they speaking to the 
women that are not in the room? It becomes all very tenuous and confusing 
what you can or should say or do. We can skip this by understanding the 
real issue, which is community inclusiveness.</p>

<p>Of course when there are real issues such as groping at conferences, or 
making people feel unwelcome because they are shown slides of half-naked 
people that look like them ... that is actually a gender issue and that 
needs to be addressed. But the example I gave was: <em>Where are the 
Indians, where are the Asians in our community?</em> This is still a 
confusing question, but not awkward.</p>

<p class="fs">Why is it not awkward?</p>

<p class="ala">(<em>laughs</em>) As I am an Indian person ... you might 
not be able to tell from the transcription?</p>

<p>It is an easy thing to do, to make generalizations of categories of 
people based on visible characteristics. Even worse, is to make 
generalizations about all individual people in that class. It is really 
easy for people in the Free Software community to subconsciously think 
there are no women in the room 'because women don't like to program', 
while we know that is really not true. I like to bring up the Indian 
people as an example because there are obviously a bunch of programmers in 
India ... the impression that they can't program, can't be the reason they 
are excluded.</p>

<p class="fs">But in a way that is even more awkward?</p>

<p class="ala">Well, maybe I don't feel it is that awkward because I see 
how to fix it, and I even see how to fix both problems at the same 
time.</p>

<p class="ala">In Free Software we are not hungry for people in the same 
way that corporate hiring departments are. We limp along and sometimes one 
or two or three people join our project per year as if by magic and we 
don't know how and we don't try to understand how. Sometimes external 
entities such as Google Summer of Code cause many many more show up at the 
doorstep of our projects, but because they are so many they don't get any 
skills for how to grow. When I co-ran this workshop at the computer 
science department at the University of Pennsylvania on how to get 
involved in Open Source, we were flooded with applicants. They were 
basically all feeling enthusiastically about Open Source but confused 
about how to get involved. 35% of the attendees were women, and if you 
look at the photos you'll see that it wasn't just women we were diverse 
on, there were lots of types of people. That's a kind of diversity-neutral 
outreach we need. It is a self-empowerment outreach: 'you will be cooler 
after this, we teach you how to do stuff' and not 'we need you to do what 
we want you to do', which is the hiring-kind of outreach.</p>

<p class="fs">And why do you think Free Software doesn't usually reach out 
in this way? Why does the F/LOSS community have such a hard time becoming 
more diverse?</p>

<p class="ala">The F/LOSS community has problems getting more people 
<strong>and</strong> being more diverse. To me, those are the same 
problems. If we would hand out flyers to people with a clear message 
saying for example: here is this nice vector drawings program called 
Inkscape. Try it out and if you want to make it even better, come to this 
session and we'll show you how. If you send out this invitation to lots of 
people, you'll reach more of them and you'll reach more diverse people. 
But the way we do things right now, is that we leave notes on bug trackers 
saying: <em>help wanted</em>. The people that read bug trackers, also know 
how to read mailing lists. To get to that point, they most likely had help 
from their friends. Their friends probably looked like them, and there you 
have a second or third degree diversity reinforcement problem. But leaving 
gender diversity and race diversity aside, it is such a small number of 
people!</p>

<p class="fs">So, to break that cycle you say there is a need to 
externalize knowledge &#8230; like you are doing with the OpenHatch 
project and with your project 'Debian for Shy People'? To not only explain 
how things technically work, but also how they function socially?</p>

<p class="ala">I don't know about externalizing ... I think I just want to 
grow our community. But when I feel more radical, I'd say we should just 
not write 'How to contribute' pages anymore. Put a giant banner there 
instead saying: <em>This is such a fun project, come hang out with us on 
IRC ... every Sunday at 3PM</em>. Five or ten people might show up, and 
you will be able to have an individual conversation. Quickly you'll cross 
a boundary &#8230; where you are no longer externalizing knowledge, but 
simply treat them as part of your group.</p>

<p>The Fedora Design Bounties are a big shining example for me. 
Ma&#237;r&#237;n Duffy has been writing blog posts about three times a 
year: <em>We want you to join our community and here is something specific 
we want you to do. If you get it right, the prize is that you are part of 
our community.</em> The person that you get this way will stick around 
because he or she came to join the community.</p>

<p class="fs">And not because you sent a chocolate cake?</p>

<p class="ala">Not for the chocolate cake, and also not for the 5000$ that 
you get over the course of a Google summer of code project. So, I question 
whether it is worth spending any time on a wiki-page explaining 'How to 
contribute' when instead you could attract people one by one, with a 100% 
success-rate.</p>

<p class="fs">Writing a 'How to contribute' page does force teams to 
reflect on what it takes to become part of their community?</p>

<p class="ala">Of course that is true. But compared to standing at a 
job-fair talking to people about their resume, 'How to contribute' pages 
are like anonymous, impersonal walls of text that are not meant to create 
communication necessarily. If we keep focusing on communicating at this 
scale, we miss out on the opportunity to make the situation better for 
individual people that are likely to help us.</p>

<p class="fs">I feel that the Free Software community is quite busy with 
efficiency. When you emphasize the importance of individual dialogue, it 
sounds like you propose a different angle, even when this in the end has 
the desired effect of attracting more loyal and reliable contributors.</p>

<p class="ala">It is amazing how valuable patience is.</p>

<p class="fs">You talked about Paul, the guy that stuck around on the IRC 
channel saying hi to people and than only later started contributing 
patches after having seen two or three people going through the process. 
You said: <em>If we had implied that this person would only be welcome 
when he was useful ... we would have lost someone that would be useful in 
the future.</em></p>

<p class="ala">The obsession with usefulness is a kind of elitism. The 
Debian project leader once made this sort of half-joke where he said: 
<em>Debian developers expect new Debian contributors to appear as fully 
formed, completely capable Debian developers.</em> That is the same kind 
of elitism that speaks from <em>You can't be here until you are 
useful.</em> By the way, the fact that this guy was some kind of 
cheerleader was awesome. The number of patches we got because he was 
standing there being friendly, was meaningful to other contributors, I am 
sure of it. The truth is ... he was always useful, even before he started 
submitting patches. Borrowing the word 'useful' from the most extreme 
code-only definition, in the end he was even useful by that definition. He 
had always been useful.</p>

<p class="fs">So it is an obsession with a certain kind of usefulness?</p>

<p class="ala">Yes.</p>

<p class="fs">It is nice to hear you bring up the value of patience. OSP 
uses the image of a frog as their logo, a reference to the frog from the 
fairy tale 'The frog and the princess'. Engaging with Free Software is a 
bit like kissing a frog; you never know whether it will turn into a prince 
before you have dared to love it! To OSP it is important not to expect 
that things will go the way you are used to ... A suspension of 
disbelief?</p>

<p class="ala">Or hopefulness! I had a couple of magic moments ... one of 
the biggest magic moments for me was when I as a high school student 
e-mailed the Linux kernel list and than I got a response! My file system 
was broken, and fsck-tools were crashing. So I was at the end of what I 
could do and I thought: let's ask these amazing people. I ended up in a 
discussion with a maintainer who told me to submit this bug-report, and 
use these dump tools ... I did all these things and compiled the latest 
version from version control because we just submitted a patch to it. By 
the end of the process I had a working file system again. From that moment 
on I thought: these magic moments will definitely happen again.</p>

<p class="fs">If you want magic moments, than streamlining the 
communication with your community might not be your best approach?</p>

<p class="ala">What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="fs">I was happy to find a panel on the program of LGM that 
addressed how this community could grow. But than I felt a bit frustrated 
by the way people were talking about it. I think the user and developer 
communities around Libre Graphics are relatively small, and all people 
actually ask for, is dialogue. There seems to be lots of concern about how 
to connect, and what tools to use for that. The discussion easily drifts 
into self-deprecating statements such as 'our website is not up-to-date' 
or 'we should have a better logo' or 'if only our documentation would be 
better'. But all of this seems more about putting off or even avoiding the 
conversation.</p>

<p class="ala">Yes, in a way it is. I think that 'conversations' are the 
best, biggest thing that F/LOSS has to offer its users, in comparison with 
proprietary software. But a lot of the behavioral habits we have within 
F/LOSS and also as people living in North America, is derived from what we 
see corporations doing. We accept this as our personal strategies because 
we do not know any alternatives. The more I say about this, the more I 
sound like a hippie but I think I'll have to take the risk 
(<em>laughs</em>).</p>

<p>If you go to the Flash website, it tells you the important things you 
need to know about Flash, and than you click download. Maybe there is a 
link to a complex survey that tries to gather data en masse of untold 
millions of users. I think that any randomly chosen website of a Libre 
Graphics project will look similar. But instead it could say when you 
click download or run the software ... <em>we're a bunch of people ... why 
don't you come talk to us on IRC?</em></p>

<p>There are a lot people that are not in the conversation because nobody 
ever invited them. This is why I think about diversity in terms of 
outreach, not in terms of criticizing existing figures. If in some 
alternate reality we would want to build a F/LOSS community that exists 
out of 90% women and 10% men, I bet we could do it. You just start with 
finding a college student at a school that has a good Computer Science 
program ... she develops a program with a bunch of her friends ... she 
puts up flyers in other colleges ... You could do this because there are 
relatively so little programmers in the world busy with developing F/LOSS 
that you can almost handpick the diversity content of your community. 
Between one and a thousand ... you could do that. There are 6 million 
thousand people on this planet and the amount of people 
<strong>not</strong> doing F/LOSS is enormous. Don't wring your hands 
about 'where are the women'. Just ask them to join and that will be 
that!</p>
