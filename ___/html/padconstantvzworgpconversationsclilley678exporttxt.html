<h1> Even when you are done, you are not done</h1>

<p>At the <strong>Libre Graphics Meeting 2008</strong>, OSP sat down with 
Chris Lilley on a small patch of grass in front of the Technical 
University in Wroclaw, Poland. Warmed up by the early May sun, we talked 
about the way standards are made, how &#8216;specs&#8217; influence the 
work of designers, programmers and managers and how this process is 
opening up to voices from outside the W3C. Chris Lilley is trained as a 
biochemist, and specialised in the application of biological computing. He 
has been involved with the World Wide Web Consortium since the 1990s, 
headed the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) working group and currently 
looks after two W3C activity areas: graphics, including PNG, CGM, 
graphical quality, and fonts, including font formats, delivery, and 
availability of font software.</p>

<p class="fs">I would like to ask you about the way standards are 
made&#8230; I think there&#8217;s a relation between the way Free, Libre 
and Open Source software works, and how standards work. But I am 
particularly interested in your announcement in your talk today that you 
want to make the process of defining the SVG standard a public process?</p>

<p class="cl">Right. So, there&#8217;s a famous quote that says that 
standards are like sausages. Your enjoyment of them is improved by not 
knowing how they&#8217;re made. <sup><a href="#42a4e96f">1</a></sup> And 
to some extent, depending on the standards body and depending on what 
you&#8217;re trying to standardize, the process can be very messy. If you 
were to describe W3C as a business proposition, it has got to fail. 
You&#8217;re taking companies who all have commercial interests, who are 
competing and you&#8217;re putting them in the same room and getting them 
to talk together and agree on something. Oddly, sometimes that works! You 
can sell them the idea that growing the market is more important and is 
going to get them more money. The other way&#8230; is that you just make 
sure that you get the managers to sign, so that their engineers can come 
and discuss standards, and then you get the engineers to talk and the 
managers are out of the way. Engineers are much more forthcoming, because 
they are more interested in sharing stuff because engineers like to share 
what they&#8217;re doing, and talk on a technical level. The worst thing 
is to get the managers involved, and even worse is to get lawyers 
involved. W3C does actually have all those three in the process. <em>Shall 
we do this work or not</em> is a managerial level that&#8217;s handled by 
the W3C advisory committee, and that&#8217;s where some people say <em>No, 
don&#8217;t work on that area</em> or <em>We have patents</em> or <em>This 
is a bad idea</em> or whatever. But often it goes through and then the 
engineers basically talk about it. Occasionally there will be patents 
disclosed, so the W3C also has a process for that. The first things are 
done are the &#8216;charters&#8217;. The charter says what the group is 
going to work on a broad scope. As soon as you&#8217;ve got your first 
draft, that further defines the scope, but it also triggers what 
it&#8217;s called an exclusion opportunity, which basically gives the 
companies I think ninety days to either declare that they have a specific 
patent and say what it&#8217;s number is and say that they exclude it, or 
not. And if they don&#8217;t, they&#8217;ve just given a royalty-free 
licence to whatever is needed to implement that spec. The interesting 
thing is that if they give the royalty-free licence they don&#8217;t have 
to say which patents they&#8217;re licencing. Other standards 
organizations build up a patent portfolio, and they list all these patents 
and they say what you have to licence. W3C doesn&#8217;t do that, unless 
they&#8217;ve excluded it which means you have to work around it or 
something like that. Based on what the spec says, all the patents that 
have been given, are given. The engineers don&#8217;t have to care. 
That&#8217;s the nice thing. The engineers can just work away, and unless 
someone waves a red flag, you just get on with it, and at the end of the 
day, it&#8217;s a royalty-free specification.</p>

<p class="fs">But if you look at the SVG standard, you could say that 
it&#8217;s been quite a bumpy road <sup><a href="#e6734368">2</a></sup> 
&#8230; What kind of work do you need to do to make a successful 
standard?</p>

<p class="fs">Wait a second. How do you make a clear distinction between 
marketing and technical comments?</p>

<p class="cl">People can make proposals that say <em>We shouldn&#8217;t 
work on this, we shouldn&#8217;t work on that</em>, but they&#8217;re 
evaluated at a technical level. If it&#8217;s <em>Don&#8217;t do it like 
that because it&#8217;s going to break as follows, here I demonstrate 
it</em> then that&#8217;s fine. If they&#8217;re like <em>Don&#8217;t do 
it because that competes with my proprietary product</em> then it&#8217;s 
like <em>Thanks for the information, but we don&#8217;t actually 
care.</em> It&#8217;s not our problem to care about that. It&#8217;s your 
problem to care about that. Part of it is sharing with the working group 
and getting the group to work together, which requires constant effort, 
but it&#8217;s no different from any sort of managerial or trust company 
type thing. There&#8217;s this sort of encouragement in it that at the end 
of the day you&#8217;re making the world a better place. You&#8217;re 
building a new thing and people will use it and whatever. And that is 
quite motivating. You need the motivation because it takes a lot longer 
than you think. You build the first spec and it looks pretty good and you 
publish it and you smooth it out a bit, put it out for comments and you 
get a ton of comments back. People say <em>If you combine this with this 
with this then that&#8217;s not going to work.</em> And you go <em>Is 
anyone really going to do that?</em> But you still have to say what 
happens. The computer still has to know what happens even if they do that. 
Ninety percent of the work is after the first draft, and it&#8217;s really 
polishing it down. In the W3C process, once you get to a certain level, 
you take it to what is euphemistically called the &#8216;last call&#8217;. 
This is a term we got from the IETF. <sup><a href="#f0e845c3">3</a></sup> 
It actually means &#8216;first call&#8217; because you never have just 
one. It&#8217;s basically a formal round of comments. You log every single 
comment that&#8217;s been made, you respond to them all, people can make 
an official objection if you haven&#8217;t responded to the comment 
correctly etcetera. Then you publish a list of what changes you&#8217;ve 
made as a basis of that.</p>

<p class="fs">What part of the SVG standardization process would you like 
to make public?</p>

<p class="cl">The part that I just said has always been public. W3C 
publishes specifications on a regular basis, and these are always public 
and freely available. The comments are made in public and responded to in 
public. What hasn&#8217;t been public has been the internal discussions of 
the group. Sometimes it can take a long time if you&#8217;ve got a lot of 
comments to process or if there&#8217;s a lot of argumentation in the 
group: people not agreeing on the direction to go, it can take a while. 
From the outside it looks like nothing is happening. Some people like to 
follow this at a very detailed level, and blog about it, and 
<em>blablabla</em>. Overtime, more and more working groups have become 
public. The SVG group just recently got recharted and it&#8217;s now a 
public group. All of its minutes are public. We meet for ninety minutes 
twice a week on a telephone call. There&#8217;s an IRC log of that and the 
minutes are published from that, and that&#8217;s all public now. <sup><a 
href="#de3c4aff">4</a></sup></p>

<p class="fs">Could you describe such a ninety minute meeting for us?</p>

<p class="fs">How many people do take part in such a meeting?</p>

<p class="cl">In the working group itself there are about 20 members and 
about 8 or so who regularly turn up, every week for years. You know, you 
lose some people over time. They get all enthusiastic and after two years, 
when you are not done, they go off and do something else, which is human 
nature. But there have been people who have been going forever. 
That&#8217;s what you need actually in a spec, you need a lot of stamina 
to see it through. It is a long term process. Even when you are done, you 
are not done because you&#8217;ve got errata, you&#8217;ve got revisions, 
you&#8217;ve got requests for new functionalities to make it into the next 
version and so on.</p>

<p class="fs">On the one hand you could say every setting of a standard is 
a violent process, some organisation forcing a standard upon others, but 
the process you describe is entirely based on consensus.</p>

<p class="cl">There&#8217;s another good quote. Tim Berners Lee was asked 
why W3C works by consensus, rather than by voting and he said: <em>W3C is 
a consensus-based organisation because I say so, damn it</em>. <sup><a 
href="#a9ec4407">5</a></sup>

  That&#8217;s the Inventor of the Web, you know&#8230; (<em>laughs</em>) 
If you have something in a spec because 51% of the people thought it was a 
good idea, you don&#8217;t end up with a design, you end up with a 
bureaucratic type decision thing. So yes, the idea is to work by 
consensus. But consensus is defined as: &#8216;no articulated 
dissent&#8217; so someone can say 'abstain' or whatever and that&#8217;s 
fine. But we don&#8217;t really do it on a voting basis, because if you do 
it like that, then you get people trying to make voting blocks and 
convince other people to vote their way&#8230; it is much better when it 
is done on the basis of a technical discussion, I mean&#8230; you either 
convince people or you don&#8217;t.</p>

<p class="fs">If you read about why this kind of work is done&#8230; you 
find different arguments. From enhancing global markets to: &#8216;in this 
way, we will create a better world for everyone&#8217;. In Tim 
Berners-Lee&#8217;s statements, these two are often mixed. If you for 
example look at the DIN standards, they are unambiguously put into the 
world as to help and support business. With Web Standards and SVG, what is 
your position?</p>

<p class="cl">Yes. So, basically&#8230; the story we tell depends on who 
we are telling it to and who is listening and why we want to convince 
them. Which I hope is not as duplicitous as it may sound. Basically, if 
you try to convince a manager that you want 20% time of an engineer for 
the coming two years, you are telling them things to convince them. Which 
is not untrue necessarily, but that is the focus they want. If you are 
talking to designers, you are telling them how that is going to help them 
when this thing becomes a spec, and the fact that they can use this on 
multiple platforms, and whatever. Remember: when the web came out, to 
exchange any document other than plain text was extremely difficult. It 
meant exchanging word processor formats, and you had to know on what 
platform you were on and in what version. The idea that you might get 
interoperability, and that the Mac and the PC could exchange characters 
that were outside ASCII was just pie in the sky stuff. When we started, 
the whole interoperability and cross-platform thing was pretty novel and 
an untested idea essentially. Now it has become pretty much solid. We have 
got a lot of focus on disabled accessibility, and also 
internationalization which is if you like another type of accessibility. 
It would be very easy for an organisation like W3C, which is essentially 
funded by companies joining it, and therefore they come from technological 
countries&#8230; it would be very easy to focus on only those countries 
and then produce specifications that are completely unusable in other 
areas of the world. Which still does sometimes happen. This is one of the 
useful things of the W3C. There is the internationalization review, and an 
accessibility review and nowadays also a mobile accessible review to make 
sure it does not just work on desktops. Some organisations make standards 
basically so they can make money. Some of the ISO <sup><a 
href="#612e15aa">6</a></sup> standards, in particular the MPEG group, 
their business model is that you contribute an engineer for a couple of 
years, you make a patent portfolio and you make a killing off licencing 
it. That is pretty much to keep out the people who were not involved in 
the standards process. Now, W3C takes quite an opposite view. The 
Royalty-Free License <sup><a href="#5b0d6d18">7</a></sup> for example, 
explicitly says: royalty-free to all. Not just the companies who were 
involved in making it, not just companies, but anyone. Individuals. Open 
Source projects. So, the funding model of the W3C is that members pay 
money, and that pays our salaries, basically. We have a staff of 60 odd or 
so, and that&#8217;s where our salaries come from, which actually makes us 
quite different from a lot of other organisations. IETF is completely 
volunteer based so you don&#8217;t know how long something is going to 
take. It might be quick, it might be 20 years, you don&#8217;t know. ISO 
is a national body largely, but the national bodies are in practice 
companies who represent that nation. But in W3C, it&#8217;s companies who 
are paying to be members. And therefore, when it started there was this 
idea of secrecy. Basically, giving them something for their money. 
That&#8217;s the trick, to make them believe they are getting something 
for their money. A lot of the ideas for W3C came from the X Consortium 
<sup><a href="#8ecb23c1">8</a></sup> actually, it is the same people who 
did it originally. And there, what the meat was&#8230; was the code. They 
would develop the code and give it to the members of the X Consortium 
three months before the public got it and that was their business benefit. 
So that is actually where our &#8216;three month rule&#8217; comes from. 
Each working group can work for three months but then they have to go 
public, have to publish. &#8216;The heartbeat rule&#8217;, we call it now. 
If you miss several heartbeats then you&#8217;re dead. But at the same 
time if you&#8217;re making a spec and you&#8217;re growing the market 
then there&#8217;s a need for it to be implemented. There&#8217;s an 
implementation page where you encourage people to implement, you report 
back on the implementations, you make a test suite, you show that every 
feature in the spec that there&#8217;s a test for&#8230; at least two 
implementations pass it. You&#8217;re not showing that everyone can use it 
at that stage. You&#8217;re showing that someone can read the spec and 
implement it. If you&#8217;ve been talking to a group of people for four 
years, you have a shared understanding with them and it could be that the 
spec isn&#8217;t understandable without that. The implementation phase 
lets you find out that people can actually implement it just by reading 
the spec. And often there are changes and clarifications made at that 
point. Obviously one of the good ways to get something implemented is to 
have Open Source people do it and often they&#8217;re much more motivated 
to do it. For them it&#8217;s cool when it is new, <em>If you give me this 
new feature it&#8217;s great we&#8217;ll do it</em> rather than: <em>Well 
that doesn&#8217;t quite fit into our product plans until the next 
quarter</em> and all that sort of stuff. Up until now, there hasn&#8217;t 
really been a good way for the Open Source people to get involved. They 
can comment on specs but they&#8217;re not involved in the discussions. 
That&#8217;s something we&#8217;re trying to change by opening up the 
groups, to make it easier for an Open Source group to contribute on an 
ongoing basis if they want to. Right from the beginning part, to the end 
where you&#8217;re polishing the tiny details in the corner.</p>

<p class="fs">I think the story of web fonts shows how an involvement of 
the Open Source people could have made a difference.</p>

<p class="cl">When web fonts were first designed, essentially you had 
Adobe and Apple pushing one way, Bitstream pushing the other way, both 
wanting W3C to make their format the one and only official web format, 
which is why you ended up with a mechanism to point to fonts without 
saying what format was required. And than you had the Netscape 4, which 
pointed off to a Bitstream format, and you had IE4 which pointed off to 
this Embedded Open Type (EOT) format. If you were a web designer, you had 
to have two different tools, one of which only worked on a Mac, and one of 
which only worked on PC, and make two different fonts for the same thing. 
Basically people wouldn&#8217;t bother. As H&#229;kon <sup><a 
href="#32b00298">9</a></sup> mentioned the only people who do actually use 
that right now really, are countries where the local language is not well 
provided for by the Operating Systems. Even now, things like WindowsXP and 
MacOSX don&#8217;t fully support some of the Indian languages. But they 
can get it into web pages by using these embedded fonts. Actually the 
other case where it has been used a lot, is SVG, not so much on the 
desktop though it does get used there but on mobiles. On the desktop 
you&#8217;ve typically got 10 or 20 fonts and you got a reasonable 
coverage. On a mobile phone, depending on how high or low ended it is, you 
might have a single font, and no <strong>bold</strong>, and it might even 
be a pixel-based font. And if you want to start doing text that skews and 
swirls, you just can&#8217;t do that with a pixel-based font. So you need 
to download the font with the content, or even put the font right there in 
the content just so that they can see something.</p>

<p class="fs">I don&#8217;t know how to talk about this, but&#8230; 
envisioning a standard before having any concrete sense of how it could be 
used and how it could change the way people work&#8230; means you also 
need to imagine how a standard might change, once people start 
implementing it?</p>

<p class="cl">I wouldn&#8217;t say that we have no idea of how it&#8217;s 
going to work. It&#8217;s more a case that there are obvious choices you 
can make, and then not so obvious choices. When work is started, 
there&#8217;s always an idea of how it would fit in with a lot of things 
and what it could be used for. It&#8217;s more the case that you later 
find that there are other things that you didn&#8217;t think of that you 
can also use it for. Usually it is defined for a particular purpose and 
than find that it can also do these other things.</p>

<p class="ph">Isn&#8217;t it so that sometimes, in that way, something 
that is completely marginal, becomes the most important?</p>

<p class="cl">It can happen, yes.</p>

<p class="nm">For me, SVG is a good example of that. As I understood it, 
it was planned to be a format for the web. And as I see it today, 
it&#8217;s more used on the desktop. I see that on the Linux desktop, for 
theming, most internals are using SVG. We are using Inkscape for SVG to 
make prints. On the other hand, browsers are really behind.</p>

<p class="cl">Browsers are getting there. Safari has got reasonably good 
support. Opera has got very good support. It really has increased a lot in 
the last couple of years. Mozilla Firefox less so. It&#8217;s getting 
there. They&#8217;ve been at it for longer, but it also seems to be going 
slower. The browsers are getting there. The implementations which I showed 
a couple of days ago, those were mobile implementations. I was showing 
them on a PC, but they were specially built demos. Because they&#8217;re 
mobile, it tends to move faster.</p>

<p class="nm">But you still have this problem that Internet Explorer is a 
slow adopter.</p>

<p class="cl">Yes, Internet Explorer has not adopted a lot of things. 
It&#8217;s been very slow to do CSS. It hasn&#8217;t yet done XHTML, 
although it has shipped with an XML parser since IE4. It hasn&#8217;t done 
SVG. Now they&#8217;ve got their own thing&#8230; Silverlight. It has been 
very hard to get Microsoft on board and getting them doing things. 
Microsoft were involved in the early part of SVG but getting things into 
IE has always been difficult. What amazes me to some extent, is the fact 
that it&#8217;s still used by about 60-70% of people. You look at what IE 
can do, and you look at what all the other browsers can do, and you wonder 
why. The thing is&#8230; it is still a break and some technologies 
don&#8217;t get used because people want to make sure that everyone can 
see them. So they go down to the lowest common denominator. Or they 
double-implement. Implement something for all the other browsers, and 
implement something separate for IE, and than have to maintain two 
different things in parallel, and tracking revisions and whatever. 
It&#8217;s a nightmare. It&#8217;s a huge economic cost because one 
browser doesn&#8217;t implement the right web stuff. (<em>laughing, 
sighing</em>)</p>

<p class="nm">My question would be: what could you give us as a kind of 
advice? How could we push this adoption where we are working? Even if it 
only is the people of Firefox to adopt SVG?</p>

<p class="cl">Bear in mind that Firefox has this thing of Trunk builds and 
Branch builds and so on. For example when Firefox 3 came out, well the 
Beta is there. Suddenly there&#8217;s a big jump in the SVG stuff because 
all the Firefox 2 was on the same branch as 1.5, and the SVG was basically 
frozen at that point. The development was ongoing but you only saw it when 
3 came out. There were a bunch of improvements there. The main missing 
features are the animation and the web fonts and both of those are being 
worked on. It&#8217;s interesting because both of those were on Acid 3. 
Often I see an acceleration of interest in getting something done because 
there&#8217;s a good test. The Acid Test <sup><a 
href="#ca812003">10</a></sup> is interesting because it&#8217;s a single 
test for a huge slew of things all at once. One person can look at it, and 
it&#8217;s either right or it&#8217;s wrong, whereas the tests that W3C 
normally produces are very much like unit tests. You test one thing and 
there&#8217;s like five hundred of them. And you have to go through, one 
after another. There&#8217;s a certain type of person who can sit through 
five hundred test on four browsers without getting bored but most people 
don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a need for this sort of aggregative test. The 
whole thing is all one. If anything is wrong, it breaks. That&#8217;s what 
Acid is designed to do. If you get one thing wrong, everything is all over 
the place. Acid 3 was a submission-based process and like a competition, 
the SVG working group was there, and put in several proposals for what 
should be in Acid 3, many of which were actually adopted. So there&#8217;s 
SVG stuff in Acid 3.</p>

<p class="fs">So&#8230; who started the Acid Test?</p>

<p class="cl">Todd Fahrner designed the original Acid 1 test, which was 
meant to exercise the tricky bits of the box-model in CSS. It ended like a 
sort Mondrian diagram, <sup><a href="#e9b71386">11</a></sup> red squares, 
and blue lines and stuff. But there was a big scope for the whole thing to 
fall apart into a train wreck if you got anything wrong. The thing is, a 
lot of web documents are pretty simple. They got paragraphs, and headings 
and stuff. They weren&#8217;t exercising very much the model. Once you got 
tables in there, they were doing it a little bit more. But it was really 
when you had stuff floated to one side, and things going around or 
whatever, and that had something floated as well. It was in that sort of 
case where it was all breaking, where people wouldn&#8217;t get 
interoperability.</p>

<p class="fs">It was&#8230; the Web Standards Project <sup><a 
href="#497ee1e1">12</a></sup> who proposed this?</p>

<p class="cl">Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>

<p class="fs">It didn&#8217;t come from a standards body.</p>

<p class="cl">No, it didn&#8217;t come from W3C. The same for Acid 2, 
H&#229;kon Wium Lie was involved in that one. He didn&#8217;t blow his own 
trumpet this morning, but he was very much involved there. Acid 3 was Ian 
Hickson, who put that together. It&#8217;s a bit different because a lot 
of it is DOM scripting stuff. It does something, and then it inquires in 
the DOM to see if it has been done correctly, and it puts that value back 
as a visual representation so you can see. It&#8217;s all very good 
because apparently it motivates the implementors to do something. 
It&#8217;s also marketable. You can have a blog posting saying we do 80% 
of Acid Test. The public can understand that. The people who are 
interested can go <em>Oh, that&#8217;s good</em>.</p>

<p class="fs">It becomes a mark of quality.</p>

<p class="nm">That&#8217;s why the idea of the Acid Test is a nice breed 
between the spec and the designer. When I was seeing the test this 
morning, I was thinking that it could be a really interesting work to do, 
not to really implement it but to think about with the students. How would 
you conceive a visual test? I think that this could be a really nice 
workshop to do in a university or in a design academy&#8230;</p>

<p class="fs">It&#8217;s the kind of reverse-reverse engineering of a 
standard which could help you understand it on different levels. You have 
to imagine how wild you can go with something. I talk about standards, and 
read them - not before going to bed - because I think that it&#8217;s 
interesting to see that while they&#8217;re quite pragmatic in how 
they&#8217;re put together, but they have an effect on the practice of, 
for example, designers. Something that I have been following with interest 
is the concept of separating form and content has become extremely 
influential in design, especially in web design. Trained as a pre-web 
designer, I&#8217;m sometimes a bit shocked by the ease with which this 
separation is made.</p>

<p class="cl">That&#8217;s interesting. Usually people say that it&#8217;s 
hard or impossible, that you can&#8217;t ever do it. The fact that 
you&#8217;re saying that it&#8217;s easy or that it comes naturally is 
interesting to me.</p>

<p class="fs">It has been appropriated by designers as something they 
want. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s interesting to look at the Web Standards 
Project where designers really fight for a separation of content and form. 
I think that this is somehow making the work of designers quite&#8230; 
boring. Could you talk a bit about how this is done?</p>

<p class="cl">It&#8217;s a continuum. You can&#8217;t say that something 
is exactly form or exactly presentation because there are gradations. If 
you take a table, you&#8217;ve already decided that you want to display 
the material in a tabular way. If it&#8217;s a real table, you should be 
able to transpose it. If you take the rows and columns, and the numbers in 
the middle then it should still work. If you&#8217;ve got 
&#8216;sales&#8217; here and if you&#8217;ve got &#8216;regions&#8217; 
there, then you should still be able to transpose that table. If 
you&#8217;re just flipping it 90 degrees then you are using it as a layout 
grid, and not as a table. That&#8217;s one obvious thing. Even then, 
deciding to display it as a tabular thing means that it probably came from 
a much bigger dataset, and you&#8217;ve just chosen to sum all of the 
sales data over one year. Another one: you have again the sales data, you 
could have it as pie chart, but you could also have it as a bar chart, you 
could have it in various other ways. You can imagine that what you would 
do is ship some XML that has that data, and then you would have a script 
or something which would turn it into an SVG pie chart. And you could have 
a bar chart, or you could also say show me only February. That interaction 
is one of the things that one can do, and arguably you&#8217;re giving it 
a different presentational form. It&#8217;s still very much a gradation. 
It&#8217;s how much re-styleability remains. You can&#8217;t ever have 
complete separation. If I&#8217;m describing a company, and 
[<strong>1</strong>] I want to do a marketing brochure, and 
[<strong>2</strong>] I want to do an annual report for the shareholders, 
and [<strong>3</strong>] I want to do an internal document for the 
engineering team. I can&#8217;t have the same content all over those three 
and just put styling on it. The type of thing I&#8217;m doing is going to 
vary for those audiences, as will the presentation. There&#8217;s a limit. 
You can&#8217;t say: here&#8217;s the &#252;berdocument, and it can be 
styled to be anything. It can&#8217;t be. The trick is to not mingle the 
style of the presentation when you don&#8217;t need to. When you do need 
to, you&#8217;re already halfway down the gradient. Keep them as far apart 
as you can, delay it as late as possible. At some point they have to be 
combined. A design will have to go into the crafting of the wording, how 
much wording, what voice is used, how it&#8217;s going to fit with the 
graphics and so on. You can&#8217;t just slap random things together and 
call it design, it looks like a train wreck. It&#8217;s a case of 
deferment. It&#8217;s not ever a case of complete separation. It&#8217;s a 
case of deferring it and not tripping yourself up. Just simple things like 
<strong>bolds</strong> and <em>italics</em> and whatever. Putting those in 
as emphasis and whatever because you might choose to have your emphasized 
words done differently. You might have a different font, you might have a 
different way of doing it, you might use letter-spacing, etc. Whereas if 
you tag that in as <em>italics</em> then you&#8217;ve only got 
<em>italics</em>, right? It&#8217;s a simple example but at the end of the 
day you&#8217;re going to have to decide how that is displayed. You 
mentioned print. In print no one sees the intermediate result. You see ink 
on paper. If I have some Greek in there and if I&#8217;ve done that by 
actually typing in Latin letters on the keyboard and putting a Greek font 
on it and out comes Greek, nobody knows. If it&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s 
being translated, there might be some problems. The more you&#8217;re 
shipping the electronic version around, the more it actually matters that 
you put in the Greek letters as Greek because you will want to revise it. 
It matters that you have flowing text rather than text that has been 
hand-ragged because when you put in the revisions you&#8217;re going to 
have to re-rag the entire thing or you can just say re-flow and fix it up 
later. Things like that.</p>

<p class="ph">The idea of time, and the question of delay is interesting. 
Not how, but when you enter to fine-tune things manually. As a designer of 
books, you&#8217;re always facing the question: when to edit, what, and on 
what level. For example, we saw this morning <sup><a 
href="#b97a88c5">13</a></sup> that the idea of having multiple skins is 
really entering the publishing business, as an idea of creativity. But 
that&#8217;s not the point, or not the complete point. When is it possible 
to enter the process? That&#8217;s something that I think we have to 
develop, to think about.</p>

<p class="ph">Designers as lawyers!</p>

<p class="nm">Yes&#8230; and the programmer would say: <em>OK, we respect 
the spec, but then we don&#8217;t expect anything else from us.</em> This 
kind of behaviour in the end, blocks a lot of exchange, instead of making 
a more creative approach possible.</p>

<p class="cl">I read about (and this is before skinning became more 
common) designers doing some multimedia things at Microsoft. You had 
designers and then there were coders. Each of them hated the other ones. 
The coders thought the designers were idiots who lived in lofts and had 
found objects in their ears. The designers thought that the programmers 
were a bunch of socially inept nerds who had no clue and never got out in 
sunlight and slept in their offices. And since they had that dynamic, they 
would never explain to each other (&#8230;)</p>

<p class="ph">Yes.</p>

<p class="cl">Yes, we know. We are part of this conference (shows LGM 
badge).</p>

<p class="ph">We&#8217;re doing an interview.</p>
