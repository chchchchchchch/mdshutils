<h1> If the design thinking is correct, the tools should be irrelevant</h1>

<p>(Type) designer Pedro Amado is amongst many other things initiator of 
TypeForge <sup><a href="#1e2f42b6">1</a></sup>, a website dedicated to the 
development of &#8216;collaborative type&#8217; with Open Source tools. 
While working as design technician at FBAUP <sup><a 
href="#8b3a13f9">2</a></sup>, he is about to finish a MA with a paper on 
collaborative methods for the creation of art and design projects. When I 
e-mailed him in <strong>2006</strong> about open font design and how he 
sees that developing, he responded with a list of useful links, but also 
with:</p>

<blockquote>Developing design teaching based on Open Source is one of my 
goals, because I think that is the future of education.</blockquote>

<p>This text is based on the conversation about design, teaching and 
software that followed.</p>

<p class="fs">You told me you are employed as &#8216;design 
technician&#8217;&#8230; what does that mean?</p>

<p class="pa">It means that I provide assistance to teachers and students 
in the Design Department. I implemented scanning/printing facilities for 
example, and currently I develop and give workshops on Digital 
Technologies &#8211; software is a BIG issue for me right now! Linux and 
Open Source software are slowly entering the design spaces of our school. 
For me it has been a &#8216;battle&#8217; to find space for these tools. I 
mean &#8211; we could migrate completely to OSS tools, but it&#8217;s a 
slow progress. Mainly because people (students) need (and want) to be 
trained in the same commercial applications as the ones they will 
encounter in their professional life.</p>

<p class="fs">How did Linux enter the design lab? How did that start?</p>

<p class="pa">It started with a personal curiosity, but also for 
economical reasons. Our school can&#8217;t afford to acquire all the 
software licenses we&#8217;d like. For example, we can&#8217;t justify to 
pay approx. 100 x 10 &#8364; licenses, just to implement the educational 
version of Fontlab on some of our computers; especially because this 
package is only used by a part of our second year design students. You can 
image what the total budget will be with all the other needs&#8230; I 
personally believe that we can find everything we need on the web. 
It&#8217;s a matter of searching long enough! So this is how I was very 
happy to find Fontforge. An Open Source tool that is solid enough to use 
in education and can produce (as far as I have been able to test) almost 
professional results in font development. At first I couldn&#8217;t grasp 
how to use it under X <sup><a href="#6f87d0f6">3</a></sup>

  on Windows, so one day I set out to try and do it on Linux&#8230; and 
one thing lead to another&#8230;</p>

<p class="fs">What got you into using OSS? Was it all one thing leading to 
another?</p>

<p class="pa">Uau&#8230; can&#8217;t remember&#8230; I believe it had to 
do with my first experiences online; I don&#8217;t think I knew the 
concept before 2000. I mean I&#8217;ve started using the web (IRC and 
basic browsing) in 1999, but I think it had to do with the search of newer 
and better tools&#8230;</p>

<p class="fs">I think I also started to get into it around that time. But 
I think I was more interested in copyleft though, than in software.</p>

<p class="pa">Oh&#8230; (blush) not me&#8230; I got into it definitely for 
the 'free beer' aspect! By 2004 I started using DTP applications on Linux 
(still in my own time) and began to think that these tools could be used 
in an educational context, if not professionally. In the beginning of 2006 
I presented a study to the coordinator of the Design Department at FBAUP, 
in which I proposed to start implementing Open Source tools as an 
alternative to the tools we were missing. Blender for 3D animation, 
FontForge for type design, Processing for interactive/graphic programming 
and others as a complement to proprietary packages: GIMP, Scribus and 
Inkscape to name the most important ones. I ran into some technical 
problems that I hope will be sorted out soon; one of the strategies is to 
run these software packages on a migration basis &#8211; as the older 
computers in our lab won&#8217;t be able to run MacOS 10.4+, we&#8217;ll 
start converting them to Linux.</p>

<p class="fs">I wanted to ask you about the relation between software and 
design. To me, economy, working process, but also aesthetics are a product 
of software, and at the same time software itself is shaped through use. I 
think the borders between software and design are not so strictly 
drawn.</p>

<p class="pa">It&#8217;s funny you put things in that perspective. I 
couldn&#8217;t agree more. Nevertheless I think that design thinking 
prevails (or it should) as it must come first when approaching problems. 
If the design thinking is correct, the tools used should be irrelevant. I 
say &#8216;should&#8217; because in a perfect environment we could work 
within a team where all tools (software/hardware) are mastered. Rarely 
this happens, so much of our design thinking is still influenced by what 
we can actually produce.</p>

<p class="fs">Do you mean to say that <em>what we can think is influenced 
by what we can make</em>? This would work for me! But often when tools are 
mastered, they disappear in the background and in my opinion that can 
become a problem.</p>

<p class="pa">I&#8217;m not sure if I follow your point. I agree with 
<em>the border between design and software is not so strict</em> 
nevertheless, I don&#8217;t agree with <em>economy, process and aesthetics 
are a product of software</em>. As you&#8217;ve come to say what we think 
is influenced by what we can make&#8230; this is an outside 
observation&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>A technique is produced inside a culture, therefore 
one&#8217;s society is conditioned by it&#8217;s techniques. Conditioned, 
not determined&#8221;</p>

<p>

</blockquote>

<p class="pa">Design, like economics and software, is a product of 
culture. Or is it the other way around? The fact is that we can&#8217;t 
really tell what comes first. Culture is defined by and defines 
technology. Therefore it&#8217;s more or less simple to accept that 
software determines (and is determined) by it&#8217;s use. This is an 
intricate process&#8230; it kind of goes roundabout on itself&#8230;</p>

<p class="fs">And where does design fit in in your opinion? Or more 
precisely: designers?</p>

<p class="pa">Design is a cultural aspect. Therefore it does not escape 
this logic. Using a practical standpoint: Design is a product of economics 
and technology. Nevertheless the best design practices (or at least the 
one&#8217;s that have endured the test of time) and the most renowned 
designers are the one&#8217;s that can escape the the economic and 
technological boundaries. The best design practices are the ones that are 
not products of economics and technology&#8230; they are kind of 
approaching a universal design status (if one exists). Of course&#8230; 
it&#8217;s very theoretical, and optimistic&#8230; but it should be like 
this&#8230; otherwise we&#8217;ll stop looking for better or newer 
solutions, and we&#8217;ll stop pushing boundaries and design as 
technology and other areas will stagnate. On the other hand, there is a 
special &#8216;school&#8217; of thought manifested through some of the 
Portuguese Design Association members, saying that the design process 
should lead the process of technological development. Henrique Cayate (I 
think it was in November last year) said that <em>design should lead the 
way to economy and technology in society</em>. I think this is a bit far 
fetched&#8230;</p>

<p class="fs">Do you think software defines form and/or content? How is 
software related to design processes?</p>

<p class="pa">I think these are the essential questions related to the use 
of OSS. Can we think about what we can make without thinking about 
process? I believe that in design processes, as in design teaching, 
concepts should be separated from techniques or software as much as 
possible.</p>

<p class="fs">To me, exactly because techniques and software are 
intertwined, software matters and should offer space for thinking 
(software should therefore not be separated from design). You could also 
say: design becomes exceptionally strong when it makes use of its context, 
and responds to it in an intelligent way. Or maybe I did not understand 
what you meant by being 'a product of'. To me that is not necessarily a 
negative point.</p>

<p class="pa">Well&#8230; yes&#8230; that could be a definition of good 
design, I guess. I think that as a cultural produce, techniques 
can&#8217;t determine society. It can and will influence it, but at the 
same time it will also just happen. When we talk about Design and Software 
I see the same principle reflected. Design being the 'culture' or society 
and software being the tools or techniques that are developed to be used 
by designers. So this is much the same as <em>Which came first? The 
chicken, or the egg?</em> Looking at it from a designers (not a software 
developers) point of view, the tools we use will always condition our 
output. Nevertheless I think it&#8217;s our role as users to push tools 
further and let developers know what we want to do with them. Whether we 
do animation on Photoshop, or print graphics on Flash that&#8217;s our 
responsibility. We have to use our tools in a responsible way. Knowing 
that the use we make of them will eventually come back at us. It&#8217;s a 
kind of responsible feedback.</p>

<p class="fs">Using Linux in a design environment is not an obvious 
choice. Most designers are practically married to their Adobe Suite. How 
come it is entering your school after all?</p>

<p class="pa">Very slowly! Linux is finally becoming valuable for 
Design/DTP area as it has been for long on the Internet/Web and 
programming areas. But you can&#8217;t expect GIMP to surpass Photoshop. 
At least not in the next few years. And this is the reality. If we can, we 
must train our students to use the best tools available. Ideally all tools 
available, so they won&#8217;t have problems when faced with a tool 
professionally. The big question is still, how we besides teaching 
students theory and design processes (with the help of free tools), help 
them to become professionals. We also have to teach them how to survive a 
professional relationship with professional tools like the Adobe Suite. As 
I am certain that Linux and OSS (or F/LOSS) will be part of 
education&#8217;s future, I am certain of it&#8217;s coexistence along 
side with commercial software like Adobe&#8217;s. It&#8217;s only a matter 
of time. Being certain of this, the essential question is: How will we 
manage to work parallel in both commercial and free worlds?</p>

<p class="fs">Do you think it is at all possible to &#8216;survive&#8217; 
on other tools than the ones Adobe offers?</p>

<p class="pa">Well&#8230; I seem not to be able to dedicate myself 
entirely to these new tools&#8230; To depend solely on OSS tools&#8230; I 
think that is not possible, at least not at this moment. But now is the 
time to take these OSS tools and start to teach with them. They must be 
implemented in our schools. I am certain that sooner or later this will be 
common practice throughout European schools.</p>

<p class="fs">Can you explain a bit more, what you mean by &#8216;real 
world&#8217;?</p>

<p class="pa">Being a professional graphic designer is what we call the 
&#8216;real world&#8217; in our school. I mean, having to work full time 
doing illustration, corporate identity, graphic design, etc., to make a 
living, deliver on time to clients and make a profit to pay the bills by 
the end of the month!</p>

<p class="fs">Do you think OSS can/should be taught differently? It seems 
self-teaching is built in to these tools and the community around it. It 
means you learn to teach others in fact &#8230; that you actually have to 
leave the concept of &#8216;mastering&#8217; behind?</p>

<p class="pa">I agree. The great thing about Linux is precisely that 
&#8211; as it is developed by users and for users &#8211; it is developing 
a sense of community around it, a sense of <em>given enough eyeballs, 
someone will figure it out</em>.</p>

<p class="fs">Well, that does not always work, but most of the 
time&#8230;</p>

<p class="pa">I believe that using Open Source tools is perfect to teach, 
especially first year students. Almost no one really understands what the 
commands behind the menus of Photoshop mean, at least not the people 
I&#8217;ve seen in my workshops. I guess GIMP won&#8217;t resolve this 
matter, but it will help them think about what they are doing to digital 
images. Especially when they have to use unfamiliar software. You first 
have to teach the design process and then the tool can be taught 
correctly, otherwise you&#8217;ll just be teaching habits or tricks. As I 
said before, as long as design prevails and not the tool/technique, and 
you teach the concepts behind the tools in the right way, people will 
adapt seamlessly to new tools, and the interface will become invisible!</p>

<p class="fs">Do you think this means you will need to restructure the 
curriculum? I imagine a class in bugreporting&#8230; or getting help 
online&#8230;</p>

<p class="pa">mmhh&#8230; that could be interesting. I&#8217;ve never 
thought about it in that way. I&#8217;ve always seen bugreporting and 
other community driven activities as part of the individual aspect of 
working with these tools&#8230; but basically you are suggesting to 
implement an &#8216;Open Source civic behavior class&#8217; or something 
like that?</p>

<p class="fs">Ehm&#8230; Yes! I think you need to learn that you own your 
tools, meaning you need to take care of them (ie: if something does not 
work, report) but at the same time you can open them up and get under the 
hood&#8230; change something small or something big. You also need to 
learn that you can expect to get help from other people than your 
tutor&#8230; and that you can teach someone else.</p>

<p class="pa">The aspect of taking responsibility, this has to be 
cultivated &#8211; a responsible use of these tools. About changing things 
under the hood&#8230; well this I think it will be more difficult. I think 
there is barely space to educate people to hack their own tools let alone 
getting under the hood and modifying them. But you are right that under 
the OSS communication model, the peer review model of analysis, 
communication is getting less and less hierarchical. You don&#8217;t have 
to be an expert to develop new or powerful tools or other things&#8230; A 
peer-review model assumes that you just need to be clever and willing to 
work with others. As long as you treat your collaborators as peers, 
whether or not they are more or less advanced than you, this will motivate 
them to work harder. You should not disregard their suggestions and reward 
them with the implementations (or critics) of their work.</p>

<p class="fs">How does that model become a reality in teaching? How can 
you practice this?</p>

<p class="pa">Well&#8230; for example use public 
communication/distribution platforms (like an expanded web forum) inside 
school, or available on the Internet; blog updates and suggestions 
constantly; keep a repository of files; encourage the use of real time 
communication technologies&#8230; as you might have noticed is almost the 
formula used in e-learning solutions.</p>

<p class="fs">And also often an argument for cutting down on teaching 
hours.</p>

<p class="pa">That actually is and isn&#8217;t true. You can and will 
(almost certainly) have less and less traditional classes, but if the 
teachers and tutors are dedicated, they will be more available than ever! 
This will mean that students and teachers will be working together in a 
more informal relationship. But it can also provoke an invasion of the 
personal space of teachers&#8230;</p>

<p class="fs">It is hard to put a border when you are that much involved. 
I am just thinking how you could use the community around Open Source 
software to help out. I mean&#8230; if the online teaching tools would be 
open to others outside the school too, this would be the advantage. It 
would also mean that as a school, you contribute to the public domain with 
your classes and courses.</p>

<p class="pa">That is another question. I think schools should contribute 
to public domain knowledge. Right now I am not sharing any of the 
knowledge about implementing OSS on a school like ours with the community. 
But if all goes well I&#8217;ll have this working by December 2006. 
I&#8217;m working on a website where I can post the handbooks for 
workshops and other useful resources.</p>

<p class="fs">I am really curious about your experiences. However 
convinced I am of the necessity to do it, I don&#8217;t think it is easy 
to open education up to the public, especially not for undergraduate 
education.</p>

<p class="pa">I do have my doubts too. If you look at it on a commercial 
perspective, students are paying for their education&#8230; should we 
share the same content to everyone? Will other people explore these 
resources in a wrong way? Will it really contribute to the rest of the 
community? What about profit? Can we afford to give this knowledge away 
for free, I mean, as a school this is almost our only source of income? 
Will the prestige gained, be worth the possible loss? These are important 
questions that I need to think more about.</p>

<p class="fs">OK, I will be back with you in 6 month to find out more! My 
last question&#8230; why would you invest time and energy in OSS when you 
think good designers should escape economical and technological 
boundaries?</p>

<p class="pa">If we invest energy on OSS tools now, we&#8217;ll have the 
advantage of already being savvy by the time they become widely accepted. 
The worst case scenario would be that you&#8217;ve wasted time perfecting 
your skills or learned a new tool that didn&#8217;t become a 
standard&#8230; How many times have we done this already in our life? In 
any way, we need to learn concepts behind the tools, learn new and 
different tools, even unnecessary ones in order to broaden our knowledge 
base &#8211; this will eventually help us think &#8216;out of the 
box&#8217; and hopefully push boundaries further [not so much as escaping 
them]. For me OSS and its movement have reached a maturity level that can 
prove it&#8217;s own worth in society. Just see Firefox &#8211; when it 
reached general user acceptance level (aka &#8216;project maturity&#8217; 
or &#8216;development state&#8217;), they started to compete directly with 
MS Internet Explorer. This will happen with the rest (at least 
that&#8217;s what I believe). It&#8217;s a matter of quality and doing the 
correct broadcast to the general public. Linux started almost as a 
personal project and now it&#8217;s a powerhouse in programming or web 
environments. Maybe because these are areas that require constant software 
and hardware attention it became an obvious and successful choice. People 
just modified it as they needed it done. Couldn&#8217;t this be done as 
effectively (or better) with commercial solutions? Of course. But could 
people develop personalized solutions to specific problems in their own 
time frame? Probably not&#8230; But it means that the people involved are, 
or can resource to, computer experts. What about the application of these 
ideas to other areas? The justice department of the Portuguese government 
(Minist&#233;rio da Justi&#231;a) is for example currently undergoing a 
massive informatics (as in the tools used) change &#8211; they are slowly 
migrating their working platform to an Open Source Linux distribution 
&#8211; Caixa M&#225;gica (although it&#8217;s maintained and given 
assistance by a commercial enterprise by the same name). By doing this, 
they&#8217;ll cut costs dramatically and will still be able to work with 
equivalent productivity (one hopes: better!). The other example is well 
known. The Spanish region of Estremadura looked for a way to cut costs on 
the implementation of information technologies in their school system and 
developed their own Linux Distro called Linex &#8211; it aggregates the 
software bundle they need, and best of all has been developed and 
constantly tweaked by them. Now Linux is becoming more accessible for 
users without technical training, and is in a WYSIWYG state of 
development, I really believe we should start using it seriously so we can 
try and test it and learn how we can use in in our everyday life (for me 
this process has already started&#8230;). People aren&#8217;t stupid. 
They&#8217;re just &#8216;change resistant&#8217;. One of the aspects I 
think that will get peoples&#8217; attention will be that a &#8216;free 
beer&#8217; is as good as a commercial one.</p>
