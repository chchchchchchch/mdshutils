<h1> The construction of a book (Aether9)</h1>

<p>This brief interview with Ludivine Loiseau and Pierre Marchand from OSP 
was made in <strong>December 2012</strong> by editor and designer Manuel 
Schmalstieg. It unravels the design process of <em>Aether9</em>, a book 
based on the archives of a collaborative adventure exploring the danger 
zones of networked audio-visual live performance. The text was published 
in that same publication.</p>

<p class="ms">Can you briefly situate the collective work of Open Source 
Publishing (OSP)?</p>

<p class="ll">OSP is a working group producing graphic design objects 
using only Libre and/or Open Source software. Founded in 2006 in the frame 
of the arts organisation Constant <sup><a href="#fdb8675e">1</a></sup>, 
the OSP caravan consists today of a dozen individuals of different 
backgrounds and practices.</p>

<p class="ms">Since how long are you working as a duo, and as a team in 
OSP?</p>

<p class="pm">3 to 4 years.</p>

<p class="ms">And how many books have you conceived?</p>

<p class="pm">As a team, it&#8217;s our first 'real' book. We previously 
worked together on a somewhat similar project of archive exploration, but 
without printed material in the end. <sup><a 
href="#04c27d20">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="ms">Similar in the type of content or in the process?</p>

<p class="pm">The process: we developed scripts to 'scrap' the project 
archives, but it&#8217;s output was more abstract; we collected the fonts 
used in all the files and produced a graph from this process. These 
archives weren&#8217;t structured, so the exploration was less linear.</p>

<p class="ms">You rapidly chose TeX/ConTeXt as a software environment to 
produce this book. Was it an obvious choice given the nature of the 
project, or did you hesitate between different approaches?</p>

<p class="ll">The construction of the book focused on two axes/threads: 
chronology and a series of 'trace-route' keywords. Within this approach of 
reading and navigation using cross-references, ConTeXt appeared as an 
appropriate tool.</p>

<p class="ms">The world of TeX <sup><a href="#f50fe083">3</a></sup> is 
very intriguing, in particular for graphic designers. It seems to me that 
it is always a struggle to push back the limits of what is 'intended' by 
the software.</p>

<p class="pm">ConTeXt is a constant fight! I wouldn&#8217;t say the same 
about other TeX system instances. With ConTeXt, we found ourselves facing 
a very personal project, because composition decisions are hardcoded to 
the liking of the package main maintainer. And when we clash with these 
decisions, we are in the strange position of using a tool while not 
agreeing with its builder.</p>

<p class="ll">As a concrete example, we could mention the automatic line 
spacing adjustments. It was a struggle to get it right on the lines that 
include keywords typeset with our custom 'traced' fonts. ConTeXt tried to 
do better, and was increasing the line height of those words, as if it 
wanted to avoid collisions.</p>

<p class="ms">Were you ever worried that what you wanted to obtain was not 
doable? Did you reject some choices &#8211; in the graphic design, the 
layout, the structure &#8211; because of software limitations?</p>

<p class="ll">Yes. Opting for a two column layout appeared to be quite 
tough when filling in the content, as it introduced many gaps. At some 
point we decided to narrow the format on a single column. To obtain the 
two columns layout in the final output, the whole book was recomposed 
during the pdf-construction, through OSPImpose.</p>

<p class="pm">This allowed us to make micro adjustments in the end of the 
production process, while introducing new games, such as shifting the 
images on double pages.</p>

<p class="ms">What is OSPImpose?</p>

<p class="pm">It&#8217;s a re-writing of a pdf imposition software that I 
wrote a couple years ago for PoDoFo.</p>

<p class="ms">Again regarding ConTeXt: this system was used for other OSP 
works &#8211; notably for the book <em>Verbindingen/Jonctions 10; Tracks 
in electr(on)ic fields</em>. <sup><a href="#56a8b042">4</a></sup> Is it 
currently the main production tool at OSP?</p>

<p class="pm">It&#8217;s more like an in-depth initiation journey!</p>

<p class="ll">But it hasn&#8217;t become a standard in our workflow yet. 
In fact, each new important book layout project raises each time the 
question of the tool. Scribus and LibreOffice (spreadsheet) are also part 
of our book making toolbox.</p>

<p class="ms">During our work session with you at Constant Variable, we 
noticed that it was difficult to install a sufficiently complete 
TeX/ConTeXt/Python environment to be able to generate the book. Is 
Pierre&#8217;s machine still the only one, or did you manage to set it up 
on other computers?</p>

<p class="pm">Now we all have similar setups, so it&#8217;s a generalized 
generation. But it&#8217;s true that this represented a difficulty at some 
times.</p>

<p class="ms">The source code and the Python scripts created for the book 
are publicly accessible on the OSP Git server. Would these sources be 
realistically re-usable? Could other publication projects use parts of the 
code ? Or, without any explicit documentation, would it be highly 
improbable?</p>

<p class="ll">Indeed, the documentation part is still on the to-do list. 
Yet a large part of the code is quite directly reusable. The code allows 
to parse different types of files. E-mails and chat-logs are often found 
in project archives. Here the Python scripts allows to order them 
according to date information, and will automatically assign a style to 
the different content fields.</p>

<p class="pm">The code itself is a documentation source, as much on 
concrete aspects, such as e-mail parsing, than on a possible architecture, 
on certain coding motives, etc. And most importantly, is consists in a 
form of common experience.</p>

<p class="ms">Do you think you will reuse some of the general 
functions/features of archive parsing for other projects ?</p>

<p class="pm">Hard to say. We haven&#8217;t anything in perspective that 
is close to the <em>Aether9</em> project. But for sure, if the need of 
such treatment comes up again, we&#8217;ll retrieve these software 
components.</p>

<p class="ll">Maybe for a publication/compilation of OSP&#8217;s 
adventures.</p>

<p class="ms">Have there been 'revelations', discoveries of unsuspected 
Python/ConText features during this development?</p>

<p class="pm">I can&#8217;t recall having this kind of pleasure. The 
revelation, at least from my point of view, happened in the very rich 
articulation of a graphical intention enacted in programming objects. It 
remains a kind of uncharted territory, exploring it is always an exciting 
adventure.</p>

<p class="ms">Three fonts are used in the book: Karla, Crimson and Consola 
Mono. Three pretty recent fonts, born in the webfonts contexts I believe. 
What considerations brought you to this choice?</p>

<p class="ll">Our typographical choices and researches lead us towards 
fonts with different style variations. As the textual content is quite 
rich and spreads on several layers, it was essential to have variation 
possibilities. Also, each project brings the opportunity to test new fonts 
and we opted for recently published fonts, indeed published, amongst 
others, on the Google font directory. Yet Karla and Crimson aren&#8217;t 
fonts specifically designed for a web usage. Karla is one of the rare 
libre grotesque fonts, and it&#8217;s other specificity it that it 
includes Tamil glyphs.</p>

<p class="ms">Apart from the original glyphs specially created for this 
book, you drew the &#199; glyph that was missing to Karla &#8230; Is it 
going to be included to its official distribution?</p>

<p class="ll">Oh, that&#8217;s a proposal for Jonathan Pinhorn. We 
haven&#8217;t contacted him yet. For the moment, this cedilla has been 
snatched from the traced variant collections.</p>

<p class="ms">Were there any surprises when printing? I am thinking in 
particular of your choice of a colored ink instead of the usual black, or 
to the low res quality (72dpi) of most of the images.</p>

<p class="pm">At the end of the process, the spontaneous decision to 
switch to blue ink was a guaranteed source of surprise. We were confident 
that it wouldn&#8217;t destroy the book, and we surely didn&#8217;t take 
too many risks since we were working with low res images. But we 
weren&#8217;t sure how the images would react to such an offense. It was 
an great surprise to see that it gave the book a very special radiance.</p>

<p class="ms">What are your next projects?</p>

<p class="ll">We are currently operating as an invited collective at the 
Valence Academy of Fine Arts in the frame of a series of workshops named 
'Up pen down'. We&#8217;re preparing a performance for the Balsamine 
theatre <sup><a href="#c4b46264">5</a></sup> on the topic of 
Bootstrapping. In April we will travel as a group to Madrid to LGRU 
<sup><a href="#73dfb6b3">6</a></sup> and LGM <sup><a 
href="#a6754f8b">7</a></sup>. We also continually work on 
'Co-position&#8221;', a project for building a post-gutenberg 
typographical tool.</p>
