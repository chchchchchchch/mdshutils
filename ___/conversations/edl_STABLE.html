<h1> Etat des Lieux</h1>

<p>The following statements were recorded by Urantsetseg Ulziikhuu (Urana) 
in <strong>2014</strong>. She studied communication in Istanbul and Leuven 
and joined Constant for a few months to document the various working 
practices at Constant Variable. Between 2011 and 2014, Variable housed 
studios for Artists, Designers, Techno Inventors, Data Activists, Cyber 
Feminists, Interactive Geeks, Textile Hackers, Video Makers, Sound Lovers, 
Beat Makers and other digital creators who were interested in using F/LOS 
software for their creative experiments.</p>

<p class="uu">Why do you think people should use and or practice Open 
Source software? What is in it for you?</p>

<p class="cw">The knitting machine that I am using normally has a computer 
from the eighties. Some have these scanners that are really old and 
usually do not work anymore. They became obsolete. If it wasn&#8217;t for 
Open Source, we couldn&#8217;t use these technologies anymore. Open Source 
developers decided that they should do something about these machines and 
found that it was not that complicated to connect these knitting machines 
directly to computers. I think it is a really good example how Open Source 
is important, because these machines are no longer produced and industry 
is no longer interested in producing them again, and they would have died 
without further use.</p>

<p>The idea that Open Source is about sharing is also important. If you 
try to do everything from zero, you just never advance. Now with Open 
Source, if somebody does something and you have access to what they do, 
and you can take it further and take it into a different direction.</p>

<p class="mm">I haven't always used Open Source software. It started at 
the Piet Zwart Institute where there was a decision made by Matthew Fuller 
and Femke Snelting who designed the program. They brought a bunch of 
people together that asked questions about how our tools influence 
practice, how they are used. And so, part of my process is then teaching 
in that program, and starting to use Free Software more and more. I should 
say, I had already been using one particular piece of Free Software which 
is FFmpeg, a program that lets you work with video. So there again there 
was a kind of connection. It was just by the virtue of the fact that it 
was one of the only tools available that could take a video, pull out 
frames, work with lots of different formats, just an amazing tool. So it 
started with convenience. But the more that I learned about the whole kind 
of approach of Open Source, the more Open Source I started to use. I first 
switched from MacOSX to maybe Dual Booting and now indeed I am pretty much 
only using Open Source. Not exclusively Open Source, because I 
occasionally use platforms online that are not free, and some 
applications.</p>

<p>I am absolutely convinced that when you use these tools, you are 
learning much more about inner workings of things, about the design 
decisions that go into a piece of software so that you are actually 
understanding at a very deep level, and this then lets you move between 
different tools. When tools change, or new things are offered, I think it 
is really a deep learning that helps you for the future. Whereas if you 
just focus on the specific particularities of one platform or piece of 
software, that is a bit fragile and will inevitably be obsolete when a 
software stops being developed or some kind of new kind of way of working 
comes about.</p>

<p class="eg">I use Open Source software every day, as I have Debian on my 
laptop. I came to it through anarchism -- I don&#8217;t have a tech 
background -- so it&#8217;s a political thing mainly. Not that F/LOSS 
represents a Utopian model of production by any means! As an artist it 
fits in with my interest in collaborative production. I think the tools we 
use should be malleable by the people who use them. Unfortunately, IT 
education needs to improve quite a lot before that ideal becomes 
reality.</p>

<p>Politically, I believe in building a culture which is democratic and 
malleable by its inhabitants, and F/LOSS makes this possible in the realm 
of software. The benefits as a user are not so great unless you are 
tech-savvy enough to really make use of that freedom. The software does 
tend to be more secure and so on, though I think we're on shaky ground if 
we try to defend F/LOSS in terms of its benefits to the end user. Using 
F/LOSS has a learning curve, challenges which I put up with because I 
believe in it socially. This would probably be a different answer from 
say, a sysadmin, someone who could see really concrete benefits of using 
F/LOSS.</p>

<p class="ch">Actually I came from Open Content and alternative licensing 
to the technical side of using GNU/Linux. My main motivation right now is 
the possibility to develop a deeper relationship with my tools. For me it 
is interesting to create my own tools for my work, rather than to use 
something predefined. Something everyone else uses. With Free Software 
this is easier -- to invent tools. Another important point is that with 
Free Software and open standards it's more likely that you will be able to 
keep track of your work. With proprietary software and formats, you are 
pretty much dependent on decisions of a software company. If the company 
decides that it will not continue an application or format, there is not 
much you can do about it. This happened to users of FreeHand. When Adobe 
acquired their competitor Macromedia they decided to discontinue the 
development of FreeHand in favour of their own product Illustrator. You 
can sign a petition, but if there is no commercial interest, most probably 
nothing will happen. Let's see what happens to Flash.</p>

<p class="cc">I studied sculpture, which is a very solitary way of 
working. Already through my studies, this idea of an artist sitting around 
in a studio somewhere, being by himself, just doing his work by himself, 
didn't make sense to me. It is maybe true for certain people, but it is 
definitely not true to me today, the person I am. I always integrated 
other people into my work, or do collaborative work. I don't really care 
about this 'it is my work' or 'it is your work', if you do something 
together, at some point the work exists by itself. For me, that is the 
greatest moment, it is just independent. It actually rejoins the 
authorship question, because I don't think you can own ideas. You can kind 
of put them out there and share them. It is organic, like things that can 
grow and that they will become bigger and bigger, become something else 
that you couldn't have ever thought. It makes the horizon much bigger. It 
is a different way of working I guess.</p>

<p>The obvious reason is that it is free, but the sharing philosophy is 
really at the core of it. I have always thought that when you share 
things, you do not get back things instantly, but you do get so much 
things in another way, not in the way you expect. But if you put in a idea 
out, use tools that are open and change them, put them out again. So there 
is lot of back and forth of communication. I think that is super 
important. It is the idea of evolving together, not just by ourselves. I 
really do believe that we do evolve much quicker if we are together than 
everybody trying to do things by his or herselves. I think it is very 
European idea to get into this individualism, this thinking of idea of 
doing things by myself, my thing. But I think we can learn a lot from 
Asia, just ways of doing, because there community is much more 
important.</p>

<p class="jc">I don&#8217;t necessarily develop like software or codes, 
because I am not a software developer. But I would say, I am involved in 
analog way. I do use Open Source software, although I have to say I do not 
much with computers. Most of my work is analog. But I do my researches on 
the website. I am a user.</p>

<p>I started to develop an antipathy against large corporations, operating 
systems or softwares, and started to look for alternatives. Then you come 
to the Linux system and Ubuntu which has a very user-friendly interface. I 
like the fact that behind the software that I am using, there is a whole 
community, who are until now without major financial interests and who 
develop tools for people like me. So now I am totally into Open Source 
software, and I try to use as much as I can. So my motivation would be I 
want to get off the track of big corporates who will always kind of lead 
you into consuming more of their products.</p>

<p class="uu">What does Free Culture mean to you? Are you taking part in a 
'Free Culture Movement'?</p>

<p class="mm">I'd like to think so, but I realised of that it is quite 
hard. Only now, I am seriously trying to really contribute back to 
projects and I wouldn't even say that I am an active contributer to Free 
Software projects. I am much more of a user and part of the system. I am 
using it in my teaching and my work, but now I try to maybe release 
software myself in some way or I try to create projects that people could 
actually use. I think it is another kind of dimension of engagement. I 
haven't really fully realised it, so yes for that question if I am 
contributing to Free Culture. Yes, but I could go lot deeper.</p>

<p class="jc">I am a big supporter of the idea of Free Culture. I think 
information should be available for people, especially for those who have 
little access to information. I mean we live in the West and we have 
access to information more or less with physical libraries and 
institutions where we can go. Specially in Asia, South America, Africa 
this is very important. There is a big gap between those who have access 
to knowledge and those don&#8217;t have access to knowledge.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a big field to explore to be able to open up information 
to people who have very poor access to information. Maybe they are not 
even able to write or read. That&#8217;s already is a big handicap. So I 
think it is a big mission in that sense.</p>

<p class="uu">Could Free Culture be seen as an opposition to 
commercialism?</p>

<p class="mm">It is a tricky question. I think no matter what, if you go 
down the stack, in terms of software and hardware, if you get down to the 
deepest level of a computer then there is little free CPU design. So I 
think it is really important to be able to work in this kind of hybrid 
spaces and to be aware of then how free Free is, and always look for 
alternatives when they are available. But to a certain degree, I think it 
is really hard to go for a total absolute. Or it is a decision, you can go 
absolute but that may mean that you are really isolated from other 
communities. So that's always a bit of balancing act, how independent can 
you be, how independent you want to be, how big does your audience need to 
be, or you community needs to be. So that's a lot of different decisions. 
Certainly, when I am working in the context of an art school with design 
practitioners, you know it is not always possible to really go completely 
independent and there are lots of implications in terms of how you work 
and whom you can work with, and the printers you can work with. So it is 
always a little bit of trade-off, but it is important to understand what 
the decisions are.</p>

<p class="eg">I think the idea of a Free Culture movement is very exciting 
and important. It has always gone on, but stating it in copyright-aware 
terms issues an important challenge to the 'all rights reserved' 
status-quo. At the same time I think it has limitations, at least in its 
current form. I'm not sure that rich white kids playing with their laptops 
is necessarily a radical act. The idea and the intention are very powerful 
though, because it does have the potential to challenge the way that power 
-- in the form of 'intellectual property' -- is distributed.</p>

<p class="ch">Copyright has become much more enforced over the last years 
than it was ever before. In a way, culture is being absorbed by companies 
trying to make money out of it. And Free Culture developed as a counter 
movement against this. When it comes to mainstream culture, you are most 
often reduced to a consumer of culture. Free Culture then is a obvious 
reaction. The idea of culture where you have the possibility to engage 
again, to become active and create your version, not just to consume 
content.</p>

<p class="uu">How could Open Source software be economically sustainable, 
in a way that is beneficial for both developers/creators and users?</p>

<p class="eg">That's a good question! A very hard one. I'm not involved 
enough in that community to really comment on its economic future. But it 
does, to me, highlight what is missing from the analysis in Free Culture 
discourse, the economic reality. It depends on where they (developers) 
work. A lot of them are employed by companies so they get a salary. Others 
do it for a hobby. I'd be interested to get accurate data on what 
percentage of F/LOSS developers are getting paid, etc. In the absence of 
that data, I think it's fair to say it is an unsolved problem. If we think 
that developers 'should' be compensated for their work, then we need to 
talk about capitalism. Or at least, about statutory funding models.</p>

<p class="mm">It is interesting that you used both 'sustainability' and 
'economic viability'. And I think those are two things very often in 
opposition. I am doing a project now about publishing workflows and future 
electronic publishing forums. And that was the one thing we looked at. 
There were several solutions on the market. One was a platform called 
'Editorial' which was a very nice website that you could use to mark down 
texts collaboratively and and then it could produce ePub format books. 
After about six months of running, it closed down as many platforms do. 
Interestingly, in their sign-off message it said: <em>You have a month to 
get your stuff out of the website, and sorry we have decided not to Open 
Source the project. As much as we loved making it, it was just too much 
work for us to keep this running</em>. In terms of real sustainability, 
Open Source of course would have allowed them to work with anybody, even 
if it is just a hobby.</p>

<p class="cw">It is very related to passion of doing these things.<br 
/>Embroidering machines have copyrighted softwares installed. The software 
itself is very expensive, around 1000&#8364;, and the software for 
professionals is 6000&#8364; to buy. Embroidering machines are very 
expensive themselves too. These softwares are very tight and closed, you 
even have to have special USB key for patterns. And there are these two 
guys who are software developers, they are trying to come up with a format 
which all embroidering machines could read. They take their time to do 
this and I think in the end if the project works out, they will probably 
get attention and probably get paid also. Because instead of giving 1000 
&#8364; to copyrighted software, maybe you would be happy to give 
50&#8364; to these people.</p>
